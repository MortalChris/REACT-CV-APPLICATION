# React CV Application

This is react practice.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
In this project I primarly used react to create a cv application for the user. I create a form with inputs that you would add information to and would change to a read only version
when you hit the submit button. Hitting the edit button allows the user to modify their inputed information.

<h2>React</h2>
<ul>
  <h3>useStates</h3>
    <li>This project used states to change the defualt value of (" ") to the value of the inputs onChange.</li>
  <h3>useEffect</h3>
    <li>Using this it would then input the changed text into an object that its values would later be displayed onto the page.</li>
</ul>
